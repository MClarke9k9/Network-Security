# Network & Security

## Overview
This repository provides an introductory, hands-on overview of **core networking and security concepts** with a focus on **real-world attack techniques, defensive strategies, and authentication mechanisms**. The material is designed to build skills in identifying threats, analyzing network activity, and securing systems using industry-standard practices.

Each section combines **theory**, **practical analysis**, and **security best practices** to help develop a strong security mindset applicable to IT support, networking, and cybersecurity roles.
